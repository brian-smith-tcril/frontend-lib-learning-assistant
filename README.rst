Purpose
=======

This React library is the Learning Assistant frontend library. It provides the frontend code for a Learning Assistant
tool. This tool is meant to be installed into the `Learning micro-frontend (MFE)`_.

This library is currently a work in progress, so documentation is not complete.

.. note::

   [TODO]

   Explicitly list anything that this MFE requires to function correctly.  This includes:

   * A list of both required and optional .env variables, and how they each
     affect the functioning of the MFE

   * A list of edx-platform `feature and waffle flags`_ that are either required
     to enable use of this MFE, or affect the behavior of the MFE in some other
     way

   * A list of IDAs or other MFEs that this MFE depends on to function correctly
